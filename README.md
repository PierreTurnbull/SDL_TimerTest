# SDL2 Speed Test

SDL2 Speed Test is a small project of mine meant to ensure that the SDL2 programs I intend to make have an optimal speed rate.

## TEST 1:

The following test respected an average 15ms per frame:
- nb = 75

## TEST 2:

The following test respected an average 15ms per frame:
- nb = 750

## TEST 3:

The following test respected an average 15ms per frame:
- nb = 1
- k = 30

## TEST 4:

The following tests respected an average 15ms per frame:
(width * height * operations/frame)
- 10 * 10 * 40000
- 600 * 480 * 100
- 1920 * 1080 * 20
